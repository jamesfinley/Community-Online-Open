<p id="p43009001.07-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v43009001-1">9:1&nbsp;</span>As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. <span class="verse-num" id="v43009002-1">2&nbsp;</span>And his disciples asked him, &#8220;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43009003-1">3&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43009004-1">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43009005-1">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43009006-1">6&nbsp;</span>Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then he anointed the man's eyes with the mud <span class="verse-num" id="v43009007-1">7&nbsp;</span>and said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Go, wash in the pool of Siloam&#8221;</span> (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing.</p>
 <p id="p43009008.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009008-1">8&nbsp;</span>The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar were saying, &#8220;Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43009009-1">9&nbsp;</span>Some said, &#8220;It is he.&#8221; Others said, &#8220;No, but he is like him.&#8221; He kept saying, &#8220;I am the man.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43009010-1">10&nbsp;</span>So they said to him, &#8220;Then how were your eyes opened?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43009011-1">11&nbsp;</span>He answered, &#8220;The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, <span class="woc">&#8216;Go to Siloam and wash.&#8217;</span> So I went and washed and received my sight.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43009012-1">12&nbsp;</span>They said to him, &#8220;Where is he?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I do not know.&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p43009013.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009013-1">13&nbsp;</span>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. <span class="verse-num" id="v43009014-1">14&nbsp;</span>Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. <span class="verse-num" id="v43009015-1">15&nbsp;</span>So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, &#8220;He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43009016-1">16&nbsp;</span>Some of the Pharisees said, &#8220;This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.&#8221; But others said, &#8220;How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?&#8221; And there was a division among them. <span class="verse-num" id="v43009017-1">17&nbsp;</span>So they said again to the blind man, &#8220;What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He is a prophet.&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p43009018.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009018-1">18&nbsp;</span>The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight <span class="verse-num" id="v43009019-1">19&nbsp;</span>and asked them, &#8220;Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43009020-1">20&nbsp;</span>His parents answered, &#8220;We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. <span class="verse-num" id="v43009021-1">21&nbsp;</span>But how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43009022-1">22&nbsp;</span>(His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f1" id="b1" title="Greek 'him'">[1]</a></span> to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.) <span class="verse-num" id="v43009023-1">23&nbsp;</span>Therefore his parents said, &#8220;He is of age; ask him.&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p43009024.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009024-1">24&nbsp;</span>So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, &#8220;Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43009025-1">25&nbsp;</span>He answered, &#8220;Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43009026-1">26&nbsp;</span>They said to him, &#8220;What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43009027-1">27&nbsp;</span>He answered them, &#8220;I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43009028-1">28&nbsp;</span>And they reviled him, saying, &#8220;You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. <span class="verse-num" id="v43009029-1">29&nbsp;</span>We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43009030-1">30&nbsp;</span>The man answered, &#8220;Why, this is an amazing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. <span class="verse-num" id="v43009031-1">31&nbsp;</span>We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him. <span class="verse-num" id="v43009032-1">32&nbsp;</span>Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind. <span class="verse-num" id="v43009033-1">33&nbsp;</span>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43009034-1">34&nbsp;</span>They answered him, &#8220;You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?&#8221; And they cast him out.</p>
 <p id="p43009035.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009035-1">35&nbsp;</span>Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Do you believe in the Son of Man?&#8221;<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f2" id="b2" title="Some manuscripts 'the Son of God'">[2]</a></span></span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43009036-1">36&nbsp;</span>He answered, &#8220;And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43009037-1">37&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;You have seen him, and it is he who is speaking to you.&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43009038-1">38&nbsp;</span>He said, &#8220;Lord, I believe,&#8221; and he worshiped him. <span class="verse-num" id="v43009039-1">39&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43009040-1">40&nbsp;</span>Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things, and said to him, &#8220;Are we also blind?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43009041-1">41&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;If you were blind, you would have no guilt;<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f3" id="b3" title="Greek 'you would not have sin'">[3]</a></span> but now that you say, &#8216;We see,&#8217; your guilt remains.</span></p>
