Avoid such people. <span class="verse-num" id="v55003006-1">6&nbsp;</span>For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, <span class="verse-num" id="v55003007-1">7&nbsp;</span>always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth. <span class="verse-num" id="v55003008-1">8&nbsp;</span>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith. <span class="verse-num" id="v55003009-1">9&nbsp;</span>But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men.</p>
