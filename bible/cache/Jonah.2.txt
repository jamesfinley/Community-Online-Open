<div class="block-indent">
<p class="line-group" id="p32002002.02-1">&#8220;I called out to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, out of my distress,<br />
<span class="indent"></span>and he answered me;<br />
out of the belly of Sheol I cried,<br />
<span class="indent"></span>and you heard my voice.<br />
 <span class="verse-num" id="v32002003-1">3&nbsp;</span>For you cast me into the deep,<br />
<span class="indent"></span>into the heart of the seas,<br />
<span class="indent"></span>and the flood surrounded me;<br />
all your waves and your billows<br />
<span class="indent"></span>passed over me.<br />
 <span class="verse-num" id="v32002004-1">4&nbsp;</span>Then I said, &#8216;I am driven away<br />
<span class="indent"></span>from your sight;<br />
yet I shall again look<br />
<span class="indent"></span>upon your holy temple.&#8217;<br />
 <span class="verse-num" id="v32002005-1">5&nbsp;</span>The waters closed in over me to take my life;<br />
<span class="indent"></span>the deep surrounded me;<br />
weeds were wrapped about my head<br />
 <span class="indent"></span><span class="verse-num" id="v32002006-1">6&nbsp;</span>at the roots of the mountains.<br />
I went down to the land<br />
<span class="indent"></span>whose bars closed upon me forever;<br />
yet you brought up my life from the pit,<br />
<span class="indent"></span>O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God.<br />
 <span class="verse-num" id="v32002007-1">7&nbsp;</span>When my life was fainting away,<br />
<span class="indent"></span>I remembered the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>,<br />
and my prayer came to you,<br />
<span class="indent"></span>into your holy temple.<br />
 <span class="verse-num" id="v32002008-1">8&nbsp;</span>Those who pay regard to vain idols<br />
<span class="indent"></span>forsake their hope of steadfast love.<br />
 <span class="verse-num" id="v32002009-1">9&nbsp;</span>But I with the voice of thanksgiving<br />
<span class="indent"></span>will sacrifice to you;<br />
what I have vowed I will pay.<br />
<span class="indent"></span>Salvation belongs to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>!&#8221;</p>
