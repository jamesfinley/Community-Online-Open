 <h3 id="p59001002.01-1">Testing of Your Faith</h3>
<p class="chapter-first" id="p59001002.05-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59001002-1">2&nbsp;</span>Count it all joy, my brothers,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f2" id="b2" title="Or 'brothers and sisters'. The plural Greek word 'adelphoi' (translated &quot;brothers&quot;) refers to siblings in a family. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, 'adelphoi' may refer either to men or to both men and women who are siblings (brothers and sisters) in God's family, the church; also verses 16, 19">[2]</a></span> when you meet trials of various kinds, <span class="verse-num" id="v59001003-1">3&nbsp;</span>for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. <span class="verse-num" id="v59001004-1">4&nbsp;</span>And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.</p>
 <p id="p59001005.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59001005-1">5&nbsp;</span>If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. <span class="verse-num" id="v59001006-1">6&nbsp;</span>But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. <span class="verse-num" id="v59001007-1">7&nbsp;</span>For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; <span class="verse-num" id="v59001008-1">8&nbsp;</span>he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</p>
 <p id="p59001009.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59001009-1">9&nbsp;</span>Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation, <span class="verse-num" id="v59001010-1">10&nbsp;</span>and the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f3" id="b3" title="Or 'a wild flower'">[3]</a></span> he will pass away. <span class="verse-num" id="v59001011-1">11&nbsp;</span>For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.</p>
 <p id="p59001012.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59001012-1">12&nbsp;</span>Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him. <span class="verse-num" id="v59001013-1">13&nbsp;</span>Let no one say when he is tempted, &#8220;I am being tempted by God,&#8221; for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. <span class="verse-num" id="v59001014-1">14&nbsp;</span>But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. <span class="verse-num" id="v59001015-1">15&nbsp;</span>Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.</p>
 <p id="p59001016.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59001016-1">16&nbsp;</span>Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers. <span class="verse-num" id="v59001017-1">17&nbsp;</span>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f4" id="b4" title="Some manuscripts 'variation due to a shadow of turning'">[4]</a></span> <span class="verse-num" id="v59001018-1">18&nbsp;</span>Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</p>
 <h3 id="p59001019.01-1">Hearing and Doing the Word</h3>
<p id="p59001019.06-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59001019-1">19&nbsp;</span>Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; <span class="verse-num" id="v59001020-1">20&nbsp;</span>for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God. <span class="verse-num" id="v59001021-1">21&nbsp;</span>Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>
 <p id="p59001022.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59001022-1">22&nbsp;</span>But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. <span class="verse-num" id="v59001023-1">23&nbsp;</span>For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. <span class="verse-num" id="v59001024-1">24&nbsp;</span>For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. <span class="verse-num" id="v59001025-1">25&nbsp;</span>But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.</p>
 <p id="p59001026.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59001026-1">26&nbsp;</span>If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person's religion is worthless. <span class="verse-num" id="v59001027-1">27&nbsp;</span>Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.</p>
