He looked, and behold, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed. <span class="verse-num" id="v02003003-1">3&nbsp;</span>And Moses said, &#8220;I will turn aside to see this great sight, why the bush is not burned.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02003004-1">4&nbsp;</span>When the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, &#8220;Moses, Moses!&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02003005-1">5&nbsp;</span>Then he said, &#8220;Do not come near; take your sandals off your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02003006-1">6&nbsp;</span>And he said, &#8220;I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&#8221; And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.</p>

I know their sufferings, <span class="verse-num" id="v02003008-1">8&nbsp;</span>and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. <span class="verse-num" id="v02003009-1">9&nbsp;</span>And now, behold, the cry of the people of Israel has come to me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. <span class="verse-num" id="v02003010-1">10&nbsp;</span>Come, I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02003011-1">11&nbsp;</span>But Moses said to God, &#8220;Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02003012-1">12&nbsp;</span>He said, &#8220;But I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.&#8221;</p>
