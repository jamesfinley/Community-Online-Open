<p class="chapter-first" id="p10001001.06-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v10001001-1">1:1&nbsp;</span>After the death of Saul, when David had returned from striking down the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag. <span class="verse-num" id="v10001002-1">2&nbsp;</span>And on the third day, behold, a man came from Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. And when he came to David, he fell to the ground and paid homage. <span class="verse-num" id="v10001003-1">3&nbsp;</span>David said to him, &#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221; And he said to him, &#8220;I have escaped from the camp of Israel.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v10001004-1">4&nbsp;</span>And David said to him, &#8220;How did it go? Tell me.&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;The people fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v10001005-1">5&nbsp;</span>Then David said to the young man who told him, &#8220;How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v10001006-1">6&nbsp;</span>And the young man who told him said, &#8220;By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear, and behold, the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him. <span class="verse-num" id="v10001007-1">7&nbsp;</span>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, &#8216;Here I am.&#8217; <span class="verse-num" id="v10001008-1">8&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, &#8216;Who are you?&#8217; I answered him, &#8216;I am an Amalekite.&#8217; <span class="verse-num" id="v10001009-1">9&nbsp;</span>And he said to me &#8216;Stand beside me and kill me, for anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers.&#8217; <span class="verse-num" id="v10001010-1">10&nbsp;</span>So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p10001011.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10001011-1">11&nbsp;</span>Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and so did all the men who were with him. <span class="verse-num" id="v10001012-1">12&nbsp;</span>And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. <span class="verse-num" id="v10001013-1">13&nbsp;</span>And David said to the young man who told him, &#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v10001014-1">14&nbsp;</span>David said to him, &#8220;How is it you were not afraid to put out your hand to destroy the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>'s anointed?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v10001015-1">15&nbsp;</span>Then David called one of the young men and said, &#8220;Go, execute him.&#8221; And he struck him down so that he died. <span class="verse-num" id="v10001016-1">16&nbsp;</span>And David said to him, &#8220;Your blood be on your head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, &#8216;I have killed the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>'s anointed.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
