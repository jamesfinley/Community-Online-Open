 <h3 id="p64001005.01-1">Support and Opposition</h3>
<p id="p64001005.04-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v64001005-1">5&nbsp;</span>Beloved, it is a faithful thing you do in all your efforts for these brothers, strangers as they are, <span class="verse-num" id="v64001006-1">6&nbsp;</span>who testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their journey in a manner worthy of God. <span class="verse-num" id="v64001007-1">7&nbsp;</span>For they have gone out for the sake of the name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles. <span class="verse-num" id="v64001008-1">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore we ought to support people like these, that we may be fellow workers for the truth.</p>

And not content with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers, and also stops those who want to and puts them out of the church.</p>
 <p id="p64001011.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v64001011-1">11&nbsp;</span>Beloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God. <span class="verse-num" id="v64001012-1">12&nbsp;</span>Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself. We also add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.</p>
