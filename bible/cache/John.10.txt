<p id="p43010001.06-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v43010001-1">10:1&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010002-1">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010003-1">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010004-1">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010005-1">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43010006-1">6&nbsp;</span>This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.</p>
 <p id="p43010007.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43010007-1">7&nbsp;</span>So Jesus again said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010008-1">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010009-1">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010010-1">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010011-1">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010012-1">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010013-1">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010014-1">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010015-1">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010016-1">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010017-1">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010018-1">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.&#8221;</span></p>
 <p id="p43010019.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43010019-1">19&nbsp;</span>There was again a division among the Jews because of these words. <span class="verse-num" id="v43010020-1">20&nbsp;</span>Many of them said, &#8220;He has a demon, and is insane; why listen to him?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43010021-1">21&nbsp;</span>Others said, &#8220;These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?&#8221;</p>
 <h3 id="p43010022.01-1">I and the Father Are One</h3>
<p id="p43010022.07-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43010022-1">22&nbsp;</span>At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter, <span class="verse-num" id="v43010023-1">23&nbsp;</span>and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon. <span class="verse-num" id="v43010024-1">24&nbsp;</span>So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, &#8220;How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43010025-1">25&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me,</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010026-1">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but you do not believe because you are not part of my flock.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010027-1">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010028-1">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010029-1">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">My Father, who has given them to me,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f1" id="b1" title="Some manuscripts 'What my Father has given to me'">[1]</a></span> is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010030-1">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I and the Father are one.&#8221;</span></p>
 <p id="p43010031.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43010031-1">31&nbsp;</span>The Jews picked up stones again to stone him. <span class="verse-num" id="v43010032-1">32&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43010033-1">33&nbsp;</span>The Jews answered him, &#8220;It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43010034-1">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Is it not written in your Law, &#8216;I said, you are gods&#8217;?</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010035-1">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If he called them gods to whom the word of God came&#8212;and Scripture cannot be broken&#8212;</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010036-1">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, &#8216;You are blaspheming,&#8217; because I said, &#8216;I am the Son of God&#8217;?</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010037-1">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me;</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43010038-1">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43010039-1">39&nbsp;</span>Again they sought to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands.</p>
 <p id="p43010040.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43010040-1">40&nbsp;</span>He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and there he remained. <span class="verse-num" id="v43010041-1">41&nbsp;</span>And many came to him. And they said, &#8220;John did no sign, but everything that John said about this man was true.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43010042-1">42&nbsp;</span>And many believed in him there.</p>
