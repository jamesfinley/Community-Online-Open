 <p id="p63001003.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v63001003-1">3&nbsp;</span>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son, in truth and love.</p>
 <h3 id="p63001004.01-1">Walking in Truth and Love</h3>
<p id="p63001004.06-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v63001004-1">4&nbsp;</span>I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father. <span class="verse-num" id="v63001005-1">5&nbsp;</span>And now I ask you, dear lady&#8212;not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning&#8212;that we love one another. <span class="verse-num" id="v63001006-1">6&nbsp;</span>And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it. <span class="verse-num" id="v63001007-1">7&nbsp;</span>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. <span class="verse-num" id="v63001008-1">8&nbsp;</span>Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f1" id="b1" title="Some manuscripts 'you'">[1]</a></span> have worked for, but may win a full reward. <span class="verse-num" id="v63001009-1">9&nbsp;</span>Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. <span class="verse-num" id="v63001010-1">10&nbsp;</span>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting, <span class="verse-num" id="v63001011-1">11&nbsp;</span>for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works.</p>
