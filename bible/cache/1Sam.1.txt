<p class="chapter-first" id="p09001001.05-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v09001001-1">1:1&nbsp;</span>There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001002-1">2&nbsp;</span>He had two wives. The name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p>
 <p id="p09001003.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001003-1">3&nbsp;</span>Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001004-1">4&nbsp;</span>On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001005-1">5&nbsp;</span>But to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had closed her womb.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f1" id="b1" title="Syriac; the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. Septuagint 'And, although he loved Hannah, he would give Hannah only one portion, because the LORD had closed her womb'">[1]</a></span> <span class="verse-num" id="v09001006-1">6&nbsp;</span>And her rival used to provoke her grievously to irritate her, because the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had closed her womb. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001007-1">7&nbsp;</span>So it went on year by year. As often as she went up to the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001008-1">8&nbsp;</span>And Elkanah, her husband, said to her, &#8220;Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p09001009.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001009-1">9&nbsp;</span>After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001010-1">10&nbsp;</span>She was deeply distressed and prayed to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> and wept bitterly. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001011-1">11&nbsp;</span>And she vowed a vow and said, &#8220;O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head.&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p09001012.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001012-1">12&nbsp;</span>As she continued praying before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, Eli observed her mouth. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001013-1">13&nbsp;</span>Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001014-1">14&nbsp;</span>And Eli said to her, &#8220;How long will you go on being drunk? Put your wine away from you.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v09001015-1">15&nbsp;</span>But Hannah answered, &#8220;No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001016-1">16&nbsp;</span>Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v09001017-1">17&nbsp;</span>Then Eli answered, &#8220;Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have made to him.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v09001018-1">18&nbsp;</span>And she said, &#8220;Let your servant find favor in your eyes.&#8221; Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.</p>
 <p id="p09001019.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001019-1">19&nbsp;</span>They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; then they went back to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> remembered her. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001020-1">20&nbsp;</span>And in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Samuel, for she said, &#8220;I have asked for him from the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.&#8221;<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f2" id="b2" title="'Samuel' sounds like the Hebrew for 'heard of God'">[2]</a></span></p>

<p id="p09001021.06-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001021-1">21&nbsp;</span>The man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> the yearly sacrifice and to pay his vow. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001022-1">22&nbsp;</span>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, &#8220;As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear in the presence of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> and dwell there forever.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v09001023-1">23&nbsp;</span>Elkanah her husband said to her, &#8220;Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him; only, may the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> establish his word.&#8221; So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001024-1">24&nbsp;</span>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f3" id="b3" title="Septuagint, Syriac; Hebrew 'three bulls'">[3]</a></span> an ephah<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f4" id="b4" title="An 'ephah' was about 3/5 bushel or 22 liters">[4]</a></span> of flour, and a skin of wine, and she brought him to the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> at Shiloh. And the child was young. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001025-1">25&nbsp;</span>Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001026-1">26&nbsp;</span>And she said, &#8220;Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001027-1">27&nbsp;</span>For this child I prayed, and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> has granted me my petition that I made to him. <span class="verse-num" id="v09001028-1">28&nbsp;</span>Therefore I have lent him to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. As long as he lives, he is lent to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
