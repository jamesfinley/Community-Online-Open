<p id="p32004001.07-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v32004001-1">4:1&nbsp;</span>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f1" id="b1" title="Hebrew 'it was exceedingly evil to Jonah'">[1]</a></span> and he was angry. <span class="verse-num" id="v32004002-1">2&nbsp;</span>And he prayed to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, is not this what I said when I was yet in my country? That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and relenting from disaster. <span class="verse-num" id="v32004003-1">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore now, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v32004004-1">4&nbsp;</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, &#8220;Do you do well to be angry?&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p32004005.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v32004005-1">5&nbsp;</span>Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, till he should see what would become of the city. <span class="verse-num" id="v32004006-1">6&nbsp;</span>Now the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> God appointed a plant<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f2" id="b2" title="Hebrew 'qiqayon', probably the castor oil plant; also verses 7, 9, 10">[2]</a></span> and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f3" id="b3" title="Or 'his evil'">[3]</a></span> So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant. <span class="verse-num" id="v32004007-1">7&nbsp;</span>But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant, so that it withered. <span class="verse-num" id="v32004008-1">8&nbsp;</span>When the sun rose, God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah so that he was faint. And he asked that he might die and said, &#8220;It is better for me to die than to live.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v32004009-1">9&nbsp;</span>But God said to Jonah, &#8220;Do you do well to be angry for the plant?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Yes, I do well to be angry, angry enough to die.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v32004010-1">10&nbsp;</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, &#8220;You pity the plant, for which you did not labor, nor did you make it grow, which came into being in a night and perished in a night. <span class="verse-num" id="v32004011-1">11&nbsp;</span>And should not I pity Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and also much cattle?&#8221;</p>
