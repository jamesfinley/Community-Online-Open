Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a worker of the ground. <span class="verse-num" id="v01004003-1">3&nbsp;</span>In the course of time Cain brought to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> an offering of the fruit of the ground, <span class="verse-num" id="v01004004-1">4&nbsp;</span>and Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had regard for Abel and his offering, <span class="verse-num" id="v01004005-1">5&nbsp;</span>but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell. <span class="verse-num" id="v01004006-1">6&nbsp;</span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Cain, &#8220;Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen? <span class="verse-num" id="v01004007-1">7&nbsp;</span>If you do well, will you not be accepted?<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f2" id="b2" title="Hebrew 'will there not be a lifting up' [of your face]?">[2]</a></span> And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f3" id="b3" title="Or 'against'">[3]</a></span> you, but you must rule over it.&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p01004008.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01004008-1">8&nbsp;</span>Cain spoke to Abel his brother.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f4" id="b4" title="Hebrew; Samaritan, Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate add 'Let us go out to the field'">[4]</a></span> And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him. <span class="verse-num" id="v01004009-1">9&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Cain, &#8220;Where is Abel your brother?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01004010-1">10&nbsp;</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, &#8220;What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground. <span class="verse-num" id="v01004011-1">11&nbsp;</span>And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. <span class="verse-num" id="v01004012-1">12&nbsp;</span>When you work the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01004013-1">13&nbsp;</span>Cain said to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, &#8220;My punishment is greater than I can bear.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f5" id="b5" title="Or 'My guilt is too great to bear'">[5]</a></span> <span class="verse-num" id="v01004014-1">14&nbsp;</span>Behold, you have driven me today away from the ground, and from your face I shall be hidden. I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01004015-1">15&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Not so! If anyone kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.&#8221; And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> put a mark on Cain, lest any who found him should attack him. <span class="verse-num" id="v01004016-1">16&nbsp;</span>Then Cain went away from the presence of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> and settled in the land of Nod,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f6" id="b6" title="'Nod' means 'wandering'">[6]</a></span> east of Eden.</p>
 <p id="p01004017.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01004017-1">17&nbsp;</span>Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. When he built a city, he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch. <span class="verse-num" id="v01004018-1">18&nbsp;</span>To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech. <span class="verse-num" id="v01004019-1">19&nbsp;</span>And Lamech took two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. <span class="verse-num" id="v01004020-1">20&nbsp;</span>Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. <span class="verse-num" id="v01004021-1">21&nbsp;</span>His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe. <span class="verse-num" id="v01004022-1">22&nbsp;</span>Zillah also bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</p>
 <p id="p01004023.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01004023-1">23&nbsp;</span>Lamech said to his wives:</p>

<span class="indent"></span>you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say:<br />
I have killed a man for wounding me,<br />
<span class="indent"></span>a young man for striking me.<br />
 <span class="verse-num" id="v01004024-1">24&nbsp;</span>If Cain's revenge is sevenfold,<br />
<span class="indent"></span>then Lamech's is seventy-sevenfold.&#8221;</p>

 <p id="p01004025.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01004025-1">25&nbsp;</span>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, &#8220;God has appointed<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f7" id="b7" title="'Seth' sounds like the Hebrew for 'he appointed'">[7]</a></span> for me another offspring instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01004026-1">26&nbsp;</span>To Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time people began to call upon the name of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p>
