<p id="p06003001.05-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v06003001-1">3:1&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua rose early in the morning and they set out from Shittim. And they came to the Jordan, he and all the people of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over. <span class="verse-num" id="v06003002-1">2&nbsp;</span>At the end of three days the officers went through the camp <span class="verse-num" id="v06003003-1">3&nbsp;</span>and commanded the people, &#8220;As soon as you see the ark of the covenant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God being carried by the Levitical priests, then you shall set out from your place and follow it. <span class="verse-num" id="v06003004-1">4&nbsp;</span>Yet there shall be a distance between you and it, about 2,000 cubits<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f1" id="b1" title="A 'cubit' was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters">[1]</a></span> in length. Do not come near it, in order that you may know the way you shall go, for you have not passed this way before.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v06003005-1">5&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua said to the people, &#8220;Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will do wonders among you.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v06003006-1">6&nbsp;</span>And Joshua said to the priests, &#8220;Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on before the people.&#8221; So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.</p>
 <p id="p06003007.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06003007-1">7&nbsp;</span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Joshua, &#8220;Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. <span class="verse-num" id="v06003008-1">8&nbsp;</span>And as for you, command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, &#8216;When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.&#8217;&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v06003009-1">9&nbsp;</span>And Joshua said to the people of Israel, &#8220;Come here and listen to the words of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v06003010-1">10&nbsp;</span>And Joshua said, &#8220;Here is how you shall know that the living God is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites. <span class="verse-num" id="v06003011-1">11&nbsp;</span>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f2" id="b2" title="Hebrew 'the ark of the covenant, the Lord of all the earth'">[2]</a></span> is passing over before you into the Jordan. <span class="verse-num" id="v06003012-1">12&nbsp;</span>Now therefore take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, from each tribe a man. <span class="verse-num" id="v06003013-1">13&nbsp;</span>And when the soles of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off from flowing, and the waters coming down from above shall stand in one heap.&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p06003014.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06003014-1">14&nbsp;</span>So when the people set out from their tents to pass over the Jordan with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people, <span class="verse-num" id="v06003015-1">15&nbsp;</span>and as soon as those bearing the ark had come as far as the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (now the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest), <span class="verse-num" id="v06003016-1">16&nbsp;</span>the waters coming down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far away, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those flowing down toward the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. And the people passed over opposite Jericho. <span class="verse-num" id="v06003017-1">17&nbsp;</span>Now the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> stood firmly on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all Israel was passing over on dry ground until all the nation finished passing over the Jordan.</p>
