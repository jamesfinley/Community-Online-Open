<p id="p43005001.09-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v43005001-1">5:1&nbsp;</span>After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>
 <p class="chapter-first" id="p43005002.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43005002-1">2&nbsp;</span>Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, in Aramaic<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f1" id="b1" title="Or 'Hebrew'">[1]</a></span> called Bethesda,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f2" id="b2" title="Some manuscripts 'Bethsaida'">[2]</a></span> which has five roofed colonnades. <span class="verse-num" id="v43005003-1">3&nbsp;</span>In these lay a multitude of invalids&#8212;blind, lame, and paralyzed.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f3" id="b3" title="Some manuscripts insert, wholly or in part, 'waiting for the moving of the water; 4for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool, and stirred the water: whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had'">[3]</a></span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43005005-1">5&nbsp;</span>One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. <span class="verse-num" id="v43005006-1">6&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Do you want to be healed?&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43005007-1">7&nbsp;</span>The sick man answered him, &#8220;Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am going another steps down before me.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43005008-1">8&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Get up, take up your bed, and walk.&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43005009-1">9&nbsp;</span>And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked.</p>
<p id="p43005009.16-1">Now that day was the Sabbath. <span class="verse-num" id="v43005010-1">10&nbsp;</span>So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, &#8220;It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43005011-1">11&nbsp;</span>But he answered them, &#8220;The man who healed me, that man said to me, <span class="woc">&#8216;Take up your bed, and walk.&#8217;</span>&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43005012-1">12&nbsp;</span>They asked him, &#8220;Who is the man who said to you, &#8216;Take up your bed and walk&#8217;?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43005013-1">13&nbsp;</span>Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place. <span class="verse-num" id="v43005014-1">14&nbsp;</span>Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you.&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43005015-1">15&nbsp;</span>The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him. <span class="verse-num" id="v43005016-1">16&nbsp;</span>And this was why the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath. <span class="verse-num" id="v43005017-1">17&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;My Father is working until now, and I am working.&#8221;</span></p>
 <h3 id="p43005018.01-1">Jesus Is Equal with God</h3>
<p id="p43005018.06-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43005018-1">18&nbsp;</span>This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</p>
 <h3 id="p43005019.01-1">The Authority of the Son</h3>
<p id="p43005019.06-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43005019-1">19&nbsp;</span>So Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f4" id="b4" title="Greek 'he'">[4]</a></span> does, that the Son does likewise.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005020-1">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005021-1">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005022-1">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005023-1">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005024-1">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.</span></p>
 <p id="p43005025.01-1"><span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005025-1">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005026-1">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005027-1">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005028-1">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005029-1">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.</span></p>
 <h3 id="p43005030.01-1">Witnesses to Jesus</h3>
<p id="p43005030.04-1"><span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005030-1">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">&#8220;I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005031-1">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If I alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not deemed true.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005032-1">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005033-1">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005034-1">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Not that the testimony that I receive is from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005035-1">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005036-1">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I am doing, bear witness about me that the Father has sent me.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005037-1">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. His voice you have never heard, his form you have never seen,</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005038-1">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe the one whom he has sent.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005039-1">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me,</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005040-1">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005041-1">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I do not receive glory from people.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005042-1">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But I know that you do not have the love of God within you.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005043-1">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005044-1">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005045-1">45&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you: Moses, on whom you have set your hope.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005046-1">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43005047-1">47&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?&#8221;</span></p>
