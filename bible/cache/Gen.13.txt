<p id="p01013001.05-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v01013001-1">13:1&nbsp;</span>So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb.</p>
 <p class="chapter-first" id="p01013002.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01013002-1">2&nbsp;</span>Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. <span class="verse-num" id="v01013003-1">3&nbsp;</span>And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, <span class="verse-num" id="v01013004-1">4&nbsp;</span>to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-num" id="v01013005-1">5&nbsp;</span>And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents, <span class="verse-num" id="v01013006-1">6&nbsp;</span>so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together, <span class="verse-num" id="v01013007-1">7&nbsp;</span>and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.</p>
 <p id="p01013008.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01013008-1">8&nbsp;</span>Then Abram said to Lot, &#8220;Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f1" id="b1" title="Hebrew 'we are men, brothers'">[1]</a></span> <span class="verse-num" id="v01013009-1">9&nbsp;</span>Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01013010-1">10&nbsp;</span>And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) <span class="verse-num" id="v01013011-1">11&nbsp;</span>So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other. <span class="verse-num" id="v01013012-1">12&nbsp;</span>Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom. <span class="verse-num" id="v01013013-1">13&nbsp;</span>Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p>
 <p id="p01013014.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01013014-1">14&nbsp;</span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, &#8220;Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, <span class="verse-num" id="v01013015-1">15&nbsp;</span>for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever. <span class="verse-num" id="v01013016-1">16&nbsp;</span>I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted. <span class="verse-num" id="v01013017-1">17&nbsp;</span>Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01013018-1">18&nbsp;</span>So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f2" id="b2" title="Or 'terebinths'">[2]</a></span> of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p>
