<p id="p02005001.05-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v02005001-1">5:1&nbsp;</span>Afterward Moses and Aaron went and said to Pharaoh, &#8220;Thus says the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, &#8216;Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.&#8217;&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02005002-1">2&nbsp;</span>But Pharaoh said, &#8220;Who is the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that I should obey his voice and let Israel go? I do not know the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and moreover, I will not let Israel go.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02005003-1">3&nbsp;</span>Then they said, &#8220;The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02005004-1">4&nbsp;</span>But the king of Egypt said to them, &#8220;Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from their work? Get back to your burdens.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02005005-1">5&nbsp;</span>And Pharaoh said, &#8220;Behold, the people of the land are now many,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f1" id="b1" title="Samaritan 'they are now more numerous than the people of the land'">[1]</a></span> and you make them rest from their burdens!&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02005006-1">6&nbsp;</span>The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen, <span class="verse-num" id="v02005007-1">7&nbsp;</span>&#8220;You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as in the past; let them go and gather straw for themselves. <span class="verse-num" id="v02005008-1">8&nbsp;</span>But the number of bricks that they made in the past you shall impose on them, you shall by no means reduce it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, &#8216;Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.&#8217; <span class="verse-num" id="v02005009-1">9&nbsp;</span>Let heavier work be laid on the men that they may labor at it and pay no regard to lying words.&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p02005010.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v02005010-1">10&nbsp;</span>So the taskmasters and the foremen of the people went out and said to the people, &#8220;Thus says Pharaoh, &#8216;I will not give you straw. <span class="verse-num" id="v02005011-1">11&nbsp;</span>Go and get your straw yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced in the least.&#8217;&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02005012-1">12&nbsp;</span>So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. <span class="verse-num" id="v02005013-1">13&nbsp;</span>The taskmasters were urgent, saying, &#8220;Complete your work, your daily task each day, as when there was straw.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02005014-1">14&nbsp;</span>And the foremen of the people of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, &#8220;Why have you not done all your task of making bricks today and yesterday, as in the past?&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p02005015.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v02005015-1">15&nbsp;</span>Then the foremen of the people of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, &#8220;Why do you treat your servants like this? <span class="verse-num" id="v02005016-1">16&nbsp;</span>No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, &#8216;Make bricks!&#8217; And behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02005017-1">17&nbsp;</span>But he said, &#8220;You are idle, you are idle; that is why you say, &#8216;Let us go and sacrifice to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.&#8217; <span class="verse-num" id="v02005018-1">18&nbsp;</span>Go now and work. No straw will be given you, but you must still deliver the same number of bricks.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02005019-1">19&nbsp;</span>The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in trouble when they said, &#8220;You shall by no means reduce your number of bricks, your daily task each day.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02005020-1">20&nbsp;</span>They met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them, as they came out from Pharaoh; <span class="verse-num" id="v02005021-1">21&nbsp;</span>and they said to them, &#8220;The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> look on you and judge, because you have made us stink in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p02005022.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v02005022-1">22&nbsp;</span>Then Moses turned to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;O Lord, why have you done evil to this people? Why did you ever send me? <span class="verse-num" id="v02005023-1">23&nbsp;</span>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people, and you have not delivered your people at all.&#8221;</p>
