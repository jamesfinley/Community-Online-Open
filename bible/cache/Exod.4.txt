 <p id="p02004010.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v02004010-1">10&nbsp;</span>But Moses said to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, &#8220;Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant, but I am slow of speech and of tongue.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02004011-1">11&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>? <span class="verse-num" id="v02004012-1">12&nbsp;</span>Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02004013-1">13&nbsp;</span>But he said, &#8220;Oh, my Lord, please send someone else.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02004014-1">14&nbsp;</span>Then the anger of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was kindled against Moses and he said, &#8220;Is there not Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Behold, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. <span class="verse-num" id="v02004015-1">15&nbsp;</span>You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you both what to do. <span class="verse-num" id="v02004016-1">16&nbsp;</span>He shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be your mouth, and you shall be as God to him. <span class="verse-num" id="v02004017-1">17&nbsp;</span>And take in your hand this staff, with which you shall do the signs.&#8221;</p>

<p id="p02004018.05-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v02004018-1">18&nbsp;</span>Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, &#8220;Please let me go back to my brothers in Egypt to see whether they are still alive.&#8221; And Jethro said to Moses, &#8220;Go in peace.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02004019-1">19&nbsp;</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses in Midian, &#8220;Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02004020-1">20&nbsp;</span>So Moses took his wife and his sons and had them ride on a donkey, and went back to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand.</p>
 <p id="p02004021.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v02004021-1">21&nbsp;</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the miracles that I have put in your power. But I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go. <span class="verse-num" id="v02004022-1">22&nbsp;</span>Then you shall say to Pharaoh, &#8216;Thus says the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, Israel is my firstborn son, <span class="verse-num" id="v02004023-1">23&nbsp;</span>and I say to you, &#8220;Let my son go that he may serve me.&#8221; If you refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your firstborn son.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p02004024.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v02004024-1">24&nbsp;</span>At a lodging place on the way the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> met him and sought to put him to death. <span class="verse-num" id="v02004025-1">25&nbsp;</span>Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin and touched Moses'<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f3" id="b3" title="Hebrew 'his'">[3]</a></span> feet with it and said, &#8220;Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me!&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v02004026-1">26&nbsp;</span>So he let him alone. It was then that she said, &#8220;A bridegroom of blood,&#8221; because of the circumcision.</p>
 <p id="p02004027.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v02004027-1">27&nbsp;</span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Aaron, &#8220;Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.&#8221; So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him. <span class="verse-num" id="v02004028-1">28&nbsp;</span>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> with which he had sent him to speak, and all the signs that he had commanded him to do. <span class="verse-num" id="v02004029-1">29&nbsp;</span>Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the people of Israel. <span class="verse-num" id="v02004030-1">30&nbsp;</span>Aaron spoke all the words that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people. <span class="verse-num" id="v02004031-1">31&nbsp;</span>And the people believed; and when they heard that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had visited the people of Israel and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed their heads and worshiped.</p>
