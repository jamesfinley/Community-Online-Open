<div class="esv-text"><p id="p17007001.01-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v17007001-1">7:1&nbsp;</span>So the king and Haman went in to feast with Queen Esther. <span class="verse-num" id="v17007002-1">2&nbsp;</span>And on the second day, as they were drinking wine after the feast, the king again said to Esther, &#8220;What is your wish, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v17007003-1">3&nbsp;</span>Then Queen Esther answered, &#8220;If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be granted me for my wish, and my people for my request. <span class="verse-num" id="v17007004-1">4&nbsp;</span>For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. If we had been sold merely as slaves, men and women, I would have been silent, for our affliction is not to be compared with the loss to the king.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v17007005-1">5&nbsp;</span>Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, &#8220;Who is he, and where is he, who has dared<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f1" id="b1" title="Hebrew 'whose heart has filled him'">[1]</a></span> to do this?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v17007006-1">6&nbsp;</span>And Esther said, &#8220;A foe and enemy! This wicked Haman!&#8221; Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen.</p>
 <h3 id="p17007007.01-1">Haman Is Hanged</h3>
<p id="p17007007.04-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v17007007-1">7&nbsp;</span>And the king arose in his wrath from the wine-drinking and went into the palace garden, but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm was determined against him by the king. <span class="verse-num" id="v17007008-1">8&nbsp;</span>And the king returned from the palace garden to the place where they were drinking wine, as Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. And the king said, &#8220;Will he even assault the queen in my presence, in my own house?&#8221; As the word left the mouth of the king, they covered Haman's face. <span class="verse-num" id="v17007009-1">9&nbsp;</span>Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king, said, &#8220;Moreover, the gallows<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f2" id="b2" title="Or 'stake'; also verse 10">[2]</a></span> that Haman has prepared for Mordecai, whose word saved the king, is standing at Haman's house, fifty cubits<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f3" id="b3" title="A 'cubit' was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters">[3]</a></span> high.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v17007010-1">10&nbsp;</span>And the king said, &#8220;Hang him on that.&#8221; So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the wrath of the king abated.</p>
