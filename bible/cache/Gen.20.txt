<p id="p01020001.04-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v01020001-1">20:1&nbsp;</span>From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. <span class="verse-num" id="v01020002-1">2&nbsp;</span>And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, &#8220;She is my sister.&#8221; And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah. <span class="verse-num" id="v01020003-1">3&nbsp;</span>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, &#8220;Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man's wife.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01020004-1">4&nbsp;</span>Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, &#8220;Lord, will you kill an innocent people? <span class="verse-num" id="v01020005-1">5&nbsp;</span>Did he not himself say to me, &#8216;She is my sister&#8217;? And she herself said, &#8216;He is my brother.&#8217; In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01020006-1">6&nbsp;</span>Then God said to him in the dream, &#8220;Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her. <span class="verse-num" id="v01020007-1">7&nbsp;</span>Now then, return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p01020008.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01020008-1">8&nbsp;</span>So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid. <span class="verse-num" id="v01020009-1">9&nbsp;</span>Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, &#8220;What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01020010-1">10&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech said to Abraham, &#8220;What did you see, that you did this thing?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01020011-1">11&nbsp;</span>Abraham said, &#8220;I did it because I thought, There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife. <span class="verse-num" id="v01020012-1">12&nbsp;</span>Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. <span class="verse-num" id="v01020013-1">13&nbsp;</span>And when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, &#8216;This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, He is my brother.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p01020014.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01020014-1">14&nbsp;</span>Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him. <span class="verse-num" id="v01020015-1">15&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech said, &#8220;Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01020016-1">16&nbsp;</span>To Sarah he said, &#8220;Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f1" id="b1" title="Hebrew 'It is a covering of eyes for all'">[1]</a></span> who are with you, and before everyone you are vindicated.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01020017-1">17&nbsp;</span>Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children. <span class="verse-num" id="v01020018-1">18&nbsp;</span>For the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.</p>
