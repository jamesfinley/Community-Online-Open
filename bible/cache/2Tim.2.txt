 <p id="p55002008.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v55002008-1">8&nbsp;</span>Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, the offspring of David, as preached in my gospel, <span class="verse-num" id="v55002009-1">9&nbsp;</span>for which I am suffering, bound with chains as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound! <span class="verse-num" id="v55002010-1">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. <span class="verse-num" id="v55002011-1">11&nbsp;</span>The saying is trustworthy, for:</p>

Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, <span class="verse-num" id="v55002018-1">18&nbsp;</span>who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some. <span class="verse-num" id="v55002019-1">19&nbsp;</span>But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: &#8220;The Lord knows those who are his,&#8221; and, &#8220;Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p55002020.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v55002020-1">20&nbsp;</span>Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable. <span class="verse-num" id="v55002021-1">21&nbsp;</span>Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f3" id="b3" title="Greek 'from these things'">[3]</a></span> he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.</p>
 <p id="p55002022.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v55002022-1">22&nbsp;</span>So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. <span class="verse-num" id="v55002023-1">23&nbsp;</span>Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies; you know that they breed quarrels. <span class="verse-num" id="v55002024-1">24&nbsp;</span>And the Lord's servant<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f4" id="b4" title="Greek 'bondservant'">[4]</a></span> must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, <span class="verse-num" id="v55002025-1">25&nbsp;</span>correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, <span class="verse-num" id="v55002026-1">26&nbsp;</span>and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.</p>
