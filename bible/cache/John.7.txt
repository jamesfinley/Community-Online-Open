<p id="p43007001.07-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v43007001-1">7:1&nbsp;</span>After this Jesus went about in Galilee. He would not go about in Judea, because the Jews<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f1" id="b1" title="Or 'Judeans'">[1]</a></span> were seeking to kill him. <span class="verse-num" id="v43007002-1">2&nbsp;</span>Now the Jews' Feast of Booths was at hand. <span class="verse-num" id="v43007003-1">3&nbsp;</span>So his brothers<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f2" id="b2" title="Or 'brothers and sisters'; also verses 5, 10">[2]</a></span> said to him, &#8220;Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples also may see the works you are doing. <span class="verse-num" id="v43007004-1">4&nbsp;</span>For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43007005-1">5&nbsp;</span>For not even his brothers believed in him. <span class="verse-num" id="v43007006-1">6&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;My time has not yet come, but your time is always here.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43007007-1">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43007008-1">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You go up to the feast. I am not<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f3" id="b3" title="Some manuscripts add 'yet'">[3]</a></span> going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come.&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43007009-1">9&nbsp;</span>After saying this, he remained in Galilee.</p>
 <p id="p43007010.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43007010-1">10&nbsp;</span>But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private. <span class="verse-num" id="v43007011-1">11&nbsp;</span>The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, &#8220;Where is he?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43007012-1">12&nbsp;</span>And there was much muttering about him among the people. While some said, &#8220;He is a good man,&#8221; others said, &#8220;No, he is leading the people astray.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43007013-1">13&nbsp;</span>Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.</p>
 <p id="p43007014.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43007014-1">14&nbsp;</span>About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching. <span class="verse-num" id="v43007015-1">15&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore marveled, saying, &#8220;How is it that this man has learning,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f4" id="b4" title="Or 'this man knows his letters'">[4]</a></span> when he has never studied?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43007016-1">16&nbsp;</span>So Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43007017-1">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If anyone's will is to do God's<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f5" id="b5" title="Greek 'his'">[5]</a></span> will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43007018-1">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43007019-1">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43007020-1">20&nbsp;</span>The crowd answered, &#8220;You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43007021-1">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;I did one work, and you all marvel at it.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43007022-1">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43007023-1">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well?</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43007024-1">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.&#8221;</span></p>
 <h3 id="p43007025.01-1">Can This Be the Christ?</h3>
<p id="p43007025.06-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43007025-1">25&nbsp;</span>Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, &#8220;Is not this the man whom they seek to kill? <span class="verse-num" id="v43007026-1">26&nbsp;</span>And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ? <span class="verse-num" id="v43007027-1">27&nbsp;</span>But we know where this man comes from, and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43007028-1">28&nbsp;</span>So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, <span class="woc">&#8220;You know me, and you know where I come from? But I have not come of my own accord. He who sent me is true, and him you do not know.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43007029-1">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me.&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43007030-1">30&nbsp;</span>So they were seeking to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. <span class="verse-num" id="v43007031-1">31&nbsp;</span>Yet many of the people believed in him. They said, &#8220;When the Christ appears, will he do more signs than this man has done?&#8221;</p>
 <h3 id="p43007032.01-1">Officers Sent to Arrest Jesus</h3>
<p id="p43007032.06-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43007032-1">32&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. <span class="verse-num" id="v43007033-1">33&nbsp;</span>Jesus then said, <span class="woc">&#8220;I will be with you a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43007034-1">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">You will seek me and you will not find me. Where I am you cannot come.&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43007035-1">35&nbsp;</span>The Jews said to one another, &#8220;Where does this man intend to go that we will not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? <span class="verse-num" id="v43007036-1">36&nbsp;</span>What does he mean by saying, <span class="woc">&#8216;You will seek me and you will not find me,&#8217;</span> and, <span class="woc">&#8216;Where I am you cannot come&#8217;</span>?&#8221;</p>
 <h3 id="p43007037.01-1">Rivers of Living Water</h3>
<p id="p43007037.05-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43007037-1">37&nbsp;</span>On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, <span class="woc">&#8220;If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v43007038-1">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Whoever believes in me, as<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f6" id="b6" title="Or 'let him come to me, and let him who believes in me drink. As'">[6]</a></span> the Scripture has said, &#8216;Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.&#8217;&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v43007039-1">39&nbsp;</span>Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</p>
 <h3 id="p43007040.01-1">Division Among the People</h3>
<p id="p43007040.05-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43007040-1">40&nbsp;</span>When they heard these words, some of the people said, &#8220;This really is the Prophet.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43007041-1">41&nbsp;</span>Others said, &#8220;This is the Christ.&#8221; But some said, &#8220;Is the Christ to come from Galilee? <span class="verse-num" id="v43007042-1">42&nbsp;</span>Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the offspring of David, and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43007043-1">43&nbsp;</span>So there was a division among the people over him. <span class="verse-num" id="v43007044-1">44&nbsp;</span>Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.</p>
 <p id="p43007045.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43007045-1">45&nbsp;</span>The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, &#8220;Why did you not bring him?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43007046-1">46&nbsp;</span>The officers answered, &#8220;No one ever spoke like this man!&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43007047-1">47&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees answered them, &#8220;Have you also been deceived? <span class="verse-num" id="v43007048-1">48&nbsp;</span>Have any of the authorities or the Pharisees believed in him? <span class="verse-num" id="v43007049-1">49&nbsp;</span>But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43007050-1">50&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus, who had gone to him before, and who was one of them, said to them, <span class="verse-num" id="v43007051-1">51&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v43007052-1">52&nbsp;</span>They replied, &#8220;Are you from Galilee too? Search and see that no prophet arises from Galilee.&#8221;</p>
