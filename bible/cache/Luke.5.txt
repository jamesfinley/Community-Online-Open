<p id="p42005001.06-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v42005001-1">5:1&nbsp;</span>On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret, <span class="verse-num" id="v42005002-1">2&nbsp;</span>and he saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. <span class="verse-num" id="v42005003-1">3&nbsp;</span>Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat. <span class="verse-num" id="v42005004-1">4&nbsp;</span>And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <span class="woc">&#8220;Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v42005005-1">5&nbsp;</span>And Simon answered, &#8220;Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v42005006-1">6&nbsp;</span>And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking. <span class="verse-num" id="v42005007-1">7&nbsp;</span>They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. <span class="verse-num" id="v42005008-1">8&nbsp;</span>But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, &#8220;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v42005009-1">9&nbsp;</span>For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken, <span class="verse-num" id="v42005010-1">10&nbsp;</span>and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, <span class="woc">&#8220;Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v42005011-1">11&nbsp;</span>And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.</p>

Who can forgive sins but God alone?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v42005022-1">22&nbsp;</span>When Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Why do you question in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v42005023-1">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">Which is easier, to say, &#8216;Your sins are forgiven you,&#8217; or to say, &#8216;Rise and walk&#8217;?</span> <span class="verse-num woc" id="v42005024-1">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&#8221;</span>&#8212;he said to the man who was paralyzed&#8212;<span class="woc">&#8220;I say to you, rise, pick up your bed and go home.&#8221;</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v42005025-1">25&nbsp;</span>And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home, glorifying God. <span class="verse-num" id="v42005026-1">26&nbsp;</span>And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, &#8220;We have seen extraordinary things today.&#8221;</p>
