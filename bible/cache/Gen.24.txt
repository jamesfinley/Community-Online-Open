<p id="p01024001.04-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v01024001-1">24:1&nbsp;</span>Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years. And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had blessed Abraham in all things. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024002-1">2&nbsp;</span>And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he had, &#8220;Put your hand under my thigh, <span class="verse-num" id="v01024003-1">3&nbsp;</span>that I may make you swear by the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of heaven and God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell, <span class="verse-num" id="v01024004-1">4&nbsp;</span>but will go to my country and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024005-1">5&nbsp;</span>The servant said to him, &#8220;Perhaps the woman may not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024006-1">6&nbsp;</span>Abraham said to him, &#8220;See to it that you do not take my son back there. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024007-1">7&nbsp;</span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me and swore to me, &#8216;To your offspring I will give this land,&#8217; he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024008-1">8&nbsp;</span>But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only you must not take my son back there.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024009-1">9&nbsp;</span>So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.</p>
 <p id="p01024010.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01024010-1">10&nbsp;</span>Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and departed, taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master; and he arose and went to Mesopotamia<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f1" id="b1" title="Hebrew 'Aram-naharaim'">[1]</a></span> to the city of Nahor. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024011-1">11&nbsp;</span>And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time when women go out to draw water. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024012-1">12&nbsp;</span>And he said, &#8220;O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024013-1">13&nbsp;</span>Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024014-1">14&nbsp;</span>Let the young woman to whom I shall say, &#8216;Please let down your jar that I may drink,&#8217; and who shall say, &#8216;Drink, and I will water your camels&#8217;&#8212;let her be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f2" id="b2" title="Or 'By her'">[2]</a></span> I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master.&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p01024015.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01024015-1">15&nbsp;</span>Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, came out with her water jar on her shoulder. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024016-1">16&nbsp;</span>The young woman was very attractive in appearance, a maiden<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f3" id="b3" title="Or 'a woman of marriageable age'">[3]</a></span> whom no man had known. She went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024017-1">17&nbsp;</span>Then the servant ran to meet her and said, &#8220;Please give me a little water to drink from your jar.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024018-1">18&nbsp;</span>She said, &#8220;Drink, my lord.&#8221; And she quickly let down her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024019-1">19&nbsp;</span>When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, &#8220;I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024020-1">20&nbsp;</span>So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water, and she drew for all his camels. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024021-1">21&nbsp;</span>The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had prospered his journey or not.</p>
 <p id="p01024022.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01024022-1">22&nbsp;</span>When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f4" id="b4" title="A 'shekel' was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams">[4]</a></span> and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels, <span class="verse-num" id="v01024023-1">23&nbsp;</span>and said, &#8220;Please tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024024-1">24&nbsp;</span>She said to him, &#8220;I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024025-1">25&nbsp;</span>She added, &#8220;We have plenty of both straw and fodder, and room to spend the night.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024026-1">26&nbsp;</span>The man bowed his head and worshiped the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> <span class="verse-num" id="v01024027-1">27&nbsp;</span>and said, &#8220;Blessed be the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his steadfast love and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> has led me in the way to the house of my master's kinsmen.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024028-1">28&nbsp;</span>Then the young woman ran and told her mother's household about these things.</p>
 <p id="p01024029.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01024029-1">29&nbsp;</span>Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban. Laban ran out toward the man, to the spring. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024030-1">30&nbsp;</span>As soon as he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and heard the words of Rebekah his sister, &#8220;Thus the man spoke to me,&#8221; he went to the man. And behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024031-1">31&nbsp;</span>He said, &#8220;Come in, O blessed of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024032-1">32&nbsp;</span>So the man came to the house and unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and there was water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024033-1">33&nbsp;</span>Then food was set before him to eat. But he said, &#8220;I will not eat until I have said what I have to say.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Speak on.&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p01024034.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01024034-1">34&nbsp;</span>So he said, &#8220;I am Abraham's servant. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024035-1">35&nbsp;</span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> has greatly blessed my master, and he has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, camels and donkeys. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024036-1">36&nbsp;</span>And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old, and to him he has given all that he has. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024037-1">37&nbsp;</span>My master made me swear, saying, &#8216;You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell, <span class="verse-num" id="v01024038-1">38&nbsp;</span>but you shall go to my father's house and to my clan and take a wife for my son.&#8217; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024039-1">39&nbsp;</span>I said to my master, &#8216;Perhaps the woman will not follow me.&#8217; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024040-1">40&nbsp;</span>But he said to me, &#8216;The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my clan and from my father's house. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024041-1">41&nbsp;</span>Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my clan. And if they will not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.&#8217;</p>
 <p id="p01024042.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01024042-1">42&nbsp;</span>&#8220;I came today to the spring and said, &#8216;O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of my master Abraham, if now you are prospering the way that I go, <span class="verse-num" id="v01024043-1">43&nbsp;</span>behold, I am standing by the spring of water. Let the virgin who comes out to draw water, to whom I shall say, &#8220;Please give me a little water from your jar to drink,&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024044-1">44&nbsp;</span>and who will say to me, &#8220;Drink, and I will draw for your camels also,&#8221; let her be the woman whom the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> has appointed for my master's son.&#8217;</p>
 <p id="p01024045.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01024045-1">45&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her water jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. I said to her, &#8216;Please let me drink.&#8217; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024046-1">46&nbsp;</span>She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder and said, &#8216;Drink, and I will give your camels drink also.&#8217; So I drank, and she gave the camels drink also. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024047-1">47&nbsp;</span>Then I asked her, &#8216;Whose daughter are you?&#8217; She said, &#8216;The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.&#8217; So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024048-1">48&nbsp;</span>Then I bowed my head and worshiped the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> and blessed the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f5" id="b5" title="Or 'faithfully'">[5]</a></span> to take the daughter of my master's kinsman for his son. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024049-1">49&nbsp;</span>Now then, if you are going to show steadfast love and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p01024050.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01024050-1">50&nbsp;</span>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, &#8220;The thing has come from the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; we cannot speak to you bad or good. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024051-1">51&nbsp;</span>Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master's son, as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> has spoken.&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p01024052.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01024052-1">52&nbsp;</span>When Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the earth before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024053-1">53&nbsp;</span>And the servant brought out jewelry of silver and of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024054-1">54&nbsp;</span>And he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there. When they arose in the morning, he said, &#8220;Send me away to my master.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024055-1">55&nbsp;</span>Her brother and her mother said, &#8220;Let the young woman remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024056-1">56&nbsp;</span>But he said to them, &#8220;Do not delay me, since the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024057-1">57&nbsp;</span>They said, &#8220;Let us call the young woman and ask her.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024058-1">58&nbsp;</span>And they called Rebekah and said to her, &#8220;Will you go with this man?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I will go.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v01024059-1">59&nbsp;</span>So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham's servant and his men. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024060-1">60&nbsp;</span>And they blessed Rebekah and said to her,</p>
<div class="block-indent">
<p class="line-group" id="p01024060.09-1">&#8220;Our sister, may you become<br />
<span class="indent"></span>thousands of ten thousands,<br />
and may your offspring possess<br />
<span class="indent"></span>the gate of those who hate him!&#8221;<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f6" id="b6" title="Or 'hate them'">[6]</a></span></p>
</div>
 <p id="p01024061.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01024061-1">61&nbsp;</span>Then Rebekah and her young women arose and rode on the camels and followed the man. Thus the servant took Rebekah and went his way.</p>
 <p id="p01024062.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v01024062-1">62&nbsp;</span>Now Isaac had returned from Beer-lahai-roi and was dwelling in the Negeb. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024063-1">63&nbsp;</span>And Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening. And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, there were camels coming. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024064-1">64&nbsp;</span>And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel <span class="verse-num" id="v01024065-1">65&nbsp;</span>and said to the servant, &#8220;Who is that man, walking in the field to meet us?&#8221; The servant said, &#8220;It is my master.&#8221; So she took her veil and covered herself. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024066-1">66&nbsp;</span>And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. <span class="verse-num" id="v01024067-1">67&nbsp;</span>Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.</p>
