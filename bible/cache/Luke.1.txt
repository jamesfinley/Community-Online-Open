<p id="p42001005.07-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42001005-1">5&nbsp;</span>In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#f1" id="b1" title="Greek 'Zacharias'">[1]</a></span> of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. <span class="verse-num" id="v42001006-1">6&nbsp;</span>And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. <span class="verse-num" id="v42001007-1">7&nbsp;</span>But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.</p>
 <p id="p42001008.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42001008-1">8&nbsp;</span>Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, <span class="verse-num" id="v42001009-1">9&nbsp;</span>according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. <span class="verse-num" id="v42001010-1">10&nbsp;</span>And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. <span class="verse-num" id="v42001011-1">11&nbsp;</span>And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. <span class="verse-num" id="v42001012-1">12&nbsp;</span>And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. <span class="verse-num" id="v42001013-1">13&nbsp;</span>But the angel said to him, &#8220;Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. <span class="verse-num" id="v42001014-1">14&nbsp;</span>And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, <span class="verse-num" id="v42001015-1">15&nbsp;</span>for he will be great before the Lord. And he must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. <span class="verse-num" id="v42001016-1">16&nbsp;</span>And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, <span class="verse-num" id="v42001017-1">17&nbsp;</span>and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.&#8221;</p>
 <p id="p42001018.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42001018-1">18&nbsp;</span>And Zechariah said to the angel, &#8220;How shall I know this?

I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. <span class="verse-num" id="v42001020-1">20&nbsp;</span>And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.&#8221; <span class="verse-num" id="v42001021-1">21&nbsp;</span>And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple. <span class="verse-num" id="v42001022-1">22&nbsp;</span>And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them and remained mute. <span class="verse-num" id="v42001023-1">23&nbsp;</span>And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home.</p>
 <p id="p42001024.01-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42001024-1">24&nbsp;</span>After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying, <span class="verse-num" id="v42001025-1">25&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.&#8221;</p>
